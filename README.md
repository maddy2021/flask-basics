# Why is Flask called a micro-framework?
- Flask is known as a micro-framework because it is lightweight and only provides components that are essential. It only provides the necessary components for web development, such as routing, request handling, sessions, and so on. For the other functionalities such as data handling, the developer can write a custom module or use an extension. This approach avoids unnecessary boilerplate code, which is not even being used.
